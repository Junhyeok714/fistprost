<p><h3>Einstein's Theory of General Relativity. ... In 1905, Albert Einstein
determined that the laws of physics are the same for all
 non-accelerating observers, and that the speed of light
  in a vacuum was independent of the motion of all
   observers. This was the theory of special relativity.

  What is general relativity? Essentially, it's a theory of gravity.
   The basic idea is that instead of being an invisible force that attracts objects to one another,
    gravity is a curving or warping of space. The more massive an object,
    the more it warps the space around it.</h3>
