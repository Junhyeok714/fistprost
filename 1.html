<h2>How does gravity work?</h2>
<h3><strong>The answer is <u>gravity</u></strong>: an invisible force that pulls objects toward each other.
... So, the closer objects are to each other,<br>
 the stronger their gravitational pull is.
  Earth's gravity comes from all its mass.
  All its mass makes a combined gravitational pull on all the mass in your body.

Gravity is a force of attraction that exists between any two masses,
 any two bodies, any two particles.
 Gravity is not just the attraction between objects and the Earth.
   It is an attraction that exists between all objects,
   everywhere in the universe.</p> What is gravity and example?
   Gravity is the force that attracts two bodies toward each other,
 the force that causes apples to fall toward the ground and the planets
  to orbit the sun.
   The more massive an object is, the stronger its gravitational pulls</h3>
